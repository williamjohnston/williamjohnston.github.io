I'm a PhD candidate in Linguistics at McGill University. 

My interests are in syntax and semantics. In my research, I investigate event structure, complex predicates, and modality. I also work with speakers of [Hmong](/hmong "Hmong language") to describe and analyze their language. My theoretical research is informed by fieldwork and typology. 

My (in-progress) dissertation investigates the structure and meaning of complex predicates in Hmong (My co-supervisors are [Jessica Coon](https://jessica.lingspace.org/ "Jessica Coon") and [Luis Alonso-Ovalle]{http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~luis.alonso-ovalle/about/ "Luis Alonso-Ovalle"}.)

In addition, I teach courses in semantic theory and linguistic typology.
