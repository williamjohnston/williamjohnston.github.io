I'm a PhD candidate in Linguistics at McGill University. My interests are in syntax and semantics. 

My research investigates event structure, complex predicates, and modality. This is deeply informed by typology and linguistic fieldwork: I work with speakers of [Hmong](/hmong "Hmong language") to describe and analyze their language. 

In my in-progress dissertation, I examine the structure and meaning of complex predicates in Hmong (and what they can tell us about other languages). My co-supervisors are [Jessica Coon](https://jessica.lingspace.org/ "Jessica Coon") and [Luis Alonso-Ovalle](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~luis.alonso-ovalle/about/ "Luis Alonso-Ovalle").

I also teach courses in semantic theory and linguistic typology.
