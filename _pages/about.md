My research interests are in syntax and semantics, particularly in the domains of argument structure, event structure, plurality, and question formation. I also do fieldwork with speakers of Hmong, a Hmong-Mien language, and am currently working to describe and analyze the several serial verb constructions in their language. 

I am currently a PhD student in the Linguistics Department at McGill University. I received my BA from Carleton College in 2013.
