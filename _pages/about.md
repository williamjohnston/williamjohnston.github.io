My research interests are in syntax and semantics, particularly in the domains of plurality, argument structure, and event structure. I do fieldwork with speakers of White Hmong, a Hmong-Mien language. 

I am currently a PhD student in the Linguistics Department at McGill University. I received my BA from Carleton College in 2013.
