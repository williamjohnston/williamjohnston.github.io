I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Université du Québec à Montréal. My research, which investigates event structure, complex predicates, lexical categories, and modality, is also informed by typology and linguistic fieldwork. In particular, I work with speakers of [Hmong](/hmong "Hmong language") to describe and analyze their language. 

My postdoctoral research is supported by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Société et culture (FRQSC) and supervised by Richard Compton. 

I obtained my PhD from McGill University in August of 2024. [My thesis](/files/Johnston-2024-Event_Structure_and_Serial_Verbs_in_Hmong.pdf), co-supervised by Jessica Coon and Luis Alonso-Ovalle, examines the structure and meaning of serial verb constructions in Hmong that are used to express causation, directed motion, and culmination (and what they can tell us about linguistic theory).

I also teach, including courses in semantic theory and linguistic typology.
