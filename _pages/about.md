I'm a syntactician/semanticist who conducts research in event structure, modality, and question formation. In my dissertation research, I work with speakers of Hmong to analyze the structure of complex events in their language. 

I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at McGill University. I received my BA from Carleton College in 2013.
