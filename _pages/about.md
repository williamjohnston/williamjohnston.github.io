I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Université du Québec à Montréal. My research, which is informed by linguistic fieldwork with speakers of [Hmong](/hmong "Hmong language"), is concerned with event structure, complex predicates, lexical categories, and modality. My research is supported by the Fonds de recherche du Québec (FRQ, Société et culture) and supervised by Richard Compton. 

I completed my PhD at McGill University. [My thesis](/files/Johnston-2024-Event_Structure_and_Serial_Verbs_in_Hmong.pdf), co-supervised by Jessica Coon and Luis Alonso-Ovalle, examines the structure and meaning of serial verb constructions in Hmong. These constructions serve a wide range of functions, expressing causation, directed motion, culmination, and other meanings. 

I teach courses in semantic theory, linguistic typology, and other topics.
