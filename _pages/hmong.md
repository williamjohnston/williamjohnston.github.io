The Hmong language is a group of dialects spoken today by over 3 million people worldwide. It is the most widely spoken of the Hmong-Mien languages of China and Southeast Asia. Hmong is traditionally spoken in the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. 

Following the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia"), tens of thousands of Hmong people fled Laos (most to refugee camps in Thailand). Many of those eventually resettled in the United States, and others followed. Today there are nearly 300,000 Hmong living in the US. Thousands more formed Hmong communities in other countries, including France, Canada, [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people")), and Australia.

Two varieties of Hmong are most common in the global diaspora. These are White Hmong (Hmoob Dawb in RPA, pronounced /m̥ɔ̃˦ dɐ͡ə˦/, sometimes spelled "Hmong Daw" or "Hmong Der") and Green Mong (Moob Leeg in RPA, pronounced /mɔ̃˦ lẽ̤˥˩/, sometimes spelled "Mong Leng"; also sometimes referred to as Blue Hmong / Moob Ntsuab (/mɔ̃˦ nd͡ʒu͡a˦/) / "Mong Njua"). Both varieties are named after the traditional dress of their speakers: specifically referring to the design and color of women's skirts. These two dialects have similar grammars and are mutually intelligible, with some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation that have been compared to differences between British and North American varieties of English. The different spellings of (H)Mong used here reflect one of these differences: Green Mong lacks the voiceless nasals found in many other Hmong dialects. 

In my research, I've primarily worked with speakers of White Hmong located in Canada, although I'm interested to work with both White Hmong and Green Mong speakers in other communities as well. 

I maintain a small collection of [Hmong linguistics resources](/hmong/resources "Hmong Linguistics Resources") for linguists and the linguistically-minded.
