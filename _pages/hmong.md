Hmong, the most widely spoken of the Hmong-Mien languages, is traditionally spoken across the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. There are at least 3.5 million speakers worldwide, with 300,000 living in diaspora communities across the US, Canada, France (Metropolitan and [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people")), and Australia. These communities mainly consist of refugees from the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia: Secret War") and their families. 

The main varieties of Hmong spoken in the diaspora are those common in Laos: White Hmong ([RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanized_Popular_Alphabet "Wikipedia: Romanized Popular Alphabet"): Hmoob Dawb; sometimes 'Hmong Daw' or 'Hmong Der') and Green Mong (RPA: Moob Leeg; sometimes 'Mong Leng'). These two varieties are mutually intelligible, with similar grammars but differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. 

In the field of linguistics, Hmong is perhaps most famous for two features: its tones and tonal morphology, and its complex system of "verb serialization". My research on Hmong, conducted with the help of Hmong speakers, focuses on these "serial verb constructions". 

For those interested in learning more about Hmong, I maintain a small list of [Hmong linguistics resources](/hmong_linguistics "Hmong Linguistics").
