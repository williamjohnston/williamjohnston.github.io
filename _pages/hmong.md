Hmong, the most widely spoken of the Hmong-Mien languages, is traditionally spoken in a dialect continuum across the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. There are 3 million speakers worldwide, with 300,000 living in diaspora in the US, Canada, France (Metropolitan and [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people")), Australia, and other countries. The diaspora mainly consists of refugees from the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia: Secret War") and their families. 

The most common varieties of Hmong spoken in the diaspora are those common in Laos: White Hmong ([RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanized_Popular_Alphabet "Wikipedia: Romanized Popular Alphabet"): Hmoob Dawb; sometimes spelled 'Hmong Daw' or 'Hmong Der') and Green Mong (RPA: Moob Leeg; sometimes spelled 'Mong Leng'). These two varieties are mutually intelligible, with similar grammars but significant differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. 

In the field of linguistics, Hmong is most famous for two features: its tones and tonal morphology, and its complex system of "verb serialization". My research on Hmong, conducted with the help of Hmong speakers, focuses on these "serial verb constructions". 

I also maintain a small list of resources for those interested in learning more about [Hmong linguistics](/hmong_linguistics "Hmong Linguistics Resources").
