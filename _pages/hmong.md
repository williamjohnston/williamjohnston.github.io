The Hmong language is a group of dialects spoken by over 3 million people worldwide. It's the most widely spoken of the Hmong-Mien languages, and is traditionally spoken in the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. 

Following the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia: Secret War"), tens of thousands of Hmong people fled Laos, most to refugee camps in Thailand. Many eventually resettled in the United States, and today there are nearly 300,000 Hmong living in the US. Others settled in Canada, (mainland) France, [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people"), Australia, and other countries.

In the global diaspora, two varieties of the Hmong language are common: 'White Hmong' (Hmong Daw or Hmong Der; [RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanized_Popular_Alphabet "Wikipedia: Romanized Popular Alphabet"): Hmoob Dawb) and 'Green Mong' (Mong Leng; RPA: Moob Leeg) which is sometimes referred to instead as 'Blue Hmong' (Mong Njua; RPA: Moob Ntsuab). These two dialects are mutually intelligible, with differences mostly in vocabulary and pronunciation. The different spellings of (H)Mong used here reflect one of these differences: Green Mong lacks the voiceless nasals found in White Hmong and other Hmong dialects. Both varieties are named after the traditional dress of their speakers: specifically, the design and color of women's skirts. 

Linguistically, Hmong is most famous for its tones and tonal morphology, and is also noteworthy for its complex system of "serial verb constructions". My research into Hmong, conducted with the help of White Hmong speakers located in Canada, has focused on the connections between serial verb constructions and event structure. (Though I'm interested in studying other aspects of the language, and working with both White Hmong and Green Mong speakers in other communities as well.) 

I also maintain a small page of [Hmong linguistics resources](/hmong/resources "Hmong Linguistics Resources") for linguists and the linguistically-minded.
