The Hmong language is a group of dialects with over 3 million speakers worldwide. It's traditionally spoken in the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, and is the most widely spoken member of the Hmong-Mien family. 

Following the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia: Secret War"), tens of thousands of Hmong people fled Laos. Many eventually resettled in the United States, and today there are nearly 300,000 Hmong living in the US alone. Others settled in Canada, both Metropolitan France and [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people"), Australia, and other countries.

In the diaspora, two varieties of the Hmong language are commonly spoken: White Hmong ([RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanized_Popular_Alphabet "Wikipedia: Romanized Popular Alphabet"): Hmoob Dawb; sometimes spelled 'Hmong Daw' or 'Hmong Der') and Green Mong (RPA: Moob Leeg; sometimes spelled 'Mong Leng'). These two dialects are mutually intelligible, with differences mostly in vocabulary and pronunciation. Other related varieties are still spoken in communities across Southeast Asia. 

Linguistically, Hmong is most famous for its tones and tonal morphology. My research, conducted with the help of Hmong speakers, focuses on another notable feature of Hmong: it's complex system of "serial verb constructions". I also maintain a small page of [Hmong linguistics resources](/hmong/resources "Hmong Linguistics Resources") for those interested in learning more about Hmong linguistics.
