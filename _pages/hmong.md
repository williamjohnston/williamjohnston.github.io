The Hmong language is a group of dialects spoken by over 3 million people worldwide. It's the most widely spoken of the Hmong-Mien languages of China and Southeast Asia. Hmong is traditionally spoken in the highlands of Southern China, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. 

Following the [Secret War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laotian_Civil_War "Wikipedia: Secret War"), tens of thousands of Hmong people fled Laos (most to refugee camps in Thailand). Many eventually resettled in the United States, and today there are nearly 300,000 Hmong living in the US. Others settled in France, Canada, [French Guiana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMf-FRl3fpI&ab_channel=FRANCE24English "From Laos to French Guiana: The story of the Hmong people"), Australia, and other countries.

Two varieties of Hmong are most common in the global diaspora. These are White Hmong or Hmong Daw ([RPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanized_Popular_Alphabet "Wikipedia: Romanized Popular Alphabet"): Hmoob Dawb) and Green Mong or Mong Leng (RPA: Moob Leeg; sometimes referred to as Blue Hmong/Mong Njua/Moob Ntsuab). Both varieties are named after the traditional dress of their speakers: specifically, the design and color of women's skirts. These two dialects are mutually intelligible, with differences mostly in vocabulary and pronunciation. The different spellings of (H)Mong used here reflect one of these differences: Green Mong lacks the voiceless nasals found in White Hmong and other Hmong dialects. 

Linguistically, Hmong is most famous for its tones and tonal morphology, as well as for its complex system of "serial verb constructions". My research into Hmong has focused on the latter, and the connections between serial verb constructions and event structure. I've primarily worked with speakers of White Hmong located in Canada, although I'm interested to work with both White Hmong and Green Mong speakers in other communities as well. 

I maintain a small collection of [Hmong linguistics resources](/hmong/resources "Hmong Linguistics Resources") for linguists and the linguistically-minded.
