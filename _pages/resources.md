The resources collected here are intended to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in learning more about Hmong linguistics. I cover a handful of examples here, all specific to White Hmong/Green Mong. Many more sources can be found in the "Archives" section below, as well as at the [Oxford Bibliographies](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0173.xml "OBO: Hmong-Mien Languages") page on Hmong-Mien languages (written and maintained by David Mortensen). It includes resources across every subfield of linguistics and as many Hmong-Mien languages as possible. ([pdf](/files/Mortensen-2014.pdf "OBO: Hmong-Mien Languages"))

## Grammars

All the grammars mentioned below are specific to either White Hmong or Green Mong. Given the high degree of grammatical similarity between the two dialects, much of the discussion in these volumes may be applicable to both. 

*	The most widely cited Hmong grammar is *Eléments de grammaire hmong blanc* by Jean Mottin. It's a thorough sketch of the language developed in consultation with native speakers, and written an author deeply familiar with the language. It is only available in French (and difficult to find in print), but an intrepid reader with a working knowledge of French or access to an online translator will find it a very useful resource. ([pdf](http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/elements_de_grammaire_hmong.pdf "Eléments de grammaire hmong blanc"))

*	A detailed (though brief) description of White Hmong grammar is given in Chapter 1 of [*Serial Verbs in White Hmong*](https://brill.com/view/title/31661 "Brill: Serial Verbs in White Hmong") by [Nerida Jarkey](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/nerida-jarkey.html "University of Sydney: Nerida Jarkey"). The remainder of the book is devoted to an in-depth description and discussion of serial verb constructions in Hmong (and is probably the most thorough resource available on the subject). 

*	An excellent description of Green Mong grammar is provided by [David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/ "Carnegie Mellon University: David Mortensen") in the collection [*The Mainland Southeast Asia Linguistic Area*](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110401981/html "DeGruyter: The Mainland Southeast Asia Linguistic Area"). This book is intended to facilitate comparisons between various languages of mainland Southeast Asia, and contains similarly-detailed descriptions of twelve others. 

## Dictionaries

*	A useful and convenient dictionary can be found at [Hmong Dictionary Online](http://hmongdictionary.us/ "Hmong Dictionary Online"). Compiled by James B. Xiong, it includes entries for both White Hmong and Green Mong. Definitions are provided in Hmong only. Requires a (free) account to access.

*	The *White Hmong - English Dictionary* compiled by Ernest E. Heimbach is also quite useful (despite its age) and provides definitions in English. ([pdf](/files/Heimbach-1978.pdf "White Hmong - English Dictionary"))

*	For Green Mong, the *English-Mong-English dictionary* (= *Phoo txhais lug Aakiv-Moob-Aakiv*) compiled by Lang Xiong, Joua Xiong, and Nao Leng Xiong may be a good print resource. (Though I have not used this myself, and sadly do not have a copy.)

## Archives

*	The [Refugee Educators' Network](http://www.reninc.org/ "RENINC: Home") maintains a [substantial collection](http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/ "RENINC: Bookshelf") of difficult-to-find books on the cultures and languages of Southeast Asia, mostly on the Hmong and Lao peoples.  

*	The [Southeast Asian Linguistics Archives](http://sealang.net/sala/ "SEALang: SALA") makes available hundreds of papers on Southeast Asian linguistics for free, many of which are rare or otherwise difficult to obtain.
