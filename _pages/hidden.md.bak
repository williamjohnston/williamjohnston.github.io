My research interests are in syntax and semantics, particularly in the domains of argument/event structure, plurality, and question formation. I conduct fieldwork with speakers of Hmong, a Hmong-Mien language, and my dissertation analyzes the complex system of verb serialization in White Hmong. 

I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at McGill University. I received my BA from Carleton College in 2013.
