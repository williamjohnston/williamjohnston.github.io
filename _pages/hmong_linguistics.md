The resources collected here are intended to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in learning more about Hmong linguistics. Many more sources can be found via the links in the "Linguistic Research" and "Archives" sections below. 

## Grammars

All the grammars presented here are specific to either White Hmong or Green Mong. Given the high degree of grammatical similarity between the two dialects, much of the discussion in these books is likely applicable to both. 

*	The most widely cited Hmong grammar is [*Eléments de grammaire hmong blanc*](http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/elements_de_grammaire_hmong.pdf "Eléments de grammaire hmong blanc") by Jean Mottin. It's a thorough sketch of White Hmong, developed in consultation with native speakers in Laos, and written by an author deeply familiar with the language. It is only available in French, but a reader with a working knowledge of French (or access to an online translator) may find it useful. 

*	A description of White Hmong grammar can be found in Chapter 1 of [*Serial Verbs in White Hmong*](https://brill.com/view/title/31661 "Brill: Serial Verbs in White Hmong") by [Nerida Jarkey](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/nerida-jarkey.html "University of Sydney: Nerida Jarkey"). The remainder of the book discusses serial verb constructions in Hmong (and is probably the most thorough resource available on the subject). 

*	A description of Green Mong grammar is provided by [David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/ "Carnegie Mellon University: David Mortensen") in the collection [*The Mainland Southeast Asia Linguistic Area*](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110401981/html "DeGruyter: The Mainland Southeast Asia Linguistic Area"). (This book also contains similarly-detailed descriptions of twelve other languages.) 

## Dictionaries

*	[*Hmong Dictionary Online*](http://hmongdictionary.us/ "Hmong Dictionary Online") is a useful online dictionary compiled by James B. Xiong. It includes entries for both White Hmong and Green Mong, though definitions are provided in Hmong only. Requires a (free) account to access.

*	The ([*White Hmong - English Dictionary*](/files/Heimbach-1978.pdf "White Hmong - English Dictionary")) compiled by Ernest E. Heimbach is quite useful (despite its age) and provides definitions in English. 

*	For Green Mong, the *English-Mong-English dictionary* (*Phoo txhais lug Aakiv-Moob-Aakiv*) compiled by Lang Xiong, Joua Xiong, and Nao Leng Xiong may be a good print resource (though I have not used this myself).

## Linguistic research

* 	I maintain an in-progress [annotated bibliography](/files/Johnston-Hmong-Bibliography.pdf) of papers on Hmong syntax and semantics that I have read over the course of my research. This is relatively small, but growing.

* 	A much broader collection of linguistic research (including sources on phonetics and phonology, sociolinguistics, and historical linguistics) can be found at the [Oxford Bibliographies](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0173.xml "OBO: Hmong-Mien Languages") page on Hmong-Mien languages, written and maintained by David Mortensen. ([pdf](/files/Mortensen-2014.pdf "OBO: Hmong-Mien Languages"))

## Archives

*	The [Hmong Studies Journal](https://www.hmongstudiesjournal.org/ "Hmong Studies Journal") hosts an extensive bibliography of scholarly work on [the Hmong language](https://www.hmongstudiesjournal.org/the-hmong-language.html "Hmong Language Bibliography"), compiled by Mark E. Pfeifer. Also hosts bibliographies on other topics.

* 	The [Hmong Language Resource Hub](https://www.hmonglanguageresourcehub.org/professional-development "Hmong Language Resource Hub") has an extensive collection of resources on Hmong language and culture, including [many linguistics articles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i22oyMEgk60-he0SDrJDOD9AztBbuT-J "Hmong Linguistics Research"). 

*	Many older (and difficult to find) papers on Hmong linguistics are available at the [Southeast Asian Linguistics Archives](http://sealang.net/sala/ "SEALang: SALA"). 

*	The [Refugee Educators' Network](http://www.reninc.org/ "RENINC: Home") maintains a [substantial collection](http://www.reninc.org/bookshelf/ "RENINC: Bookshelf") of difficult-to-find books on Hmong, Lao, and other languages and cultures of Southeast Asia.
